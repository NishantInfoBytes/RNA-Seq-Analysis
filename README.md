## RNA-Seq-Analysis
Using high-throughput sequencing techniques to reveal transcriptomics dynamics.

Overview:
This repository contains a pipeline for processing RNA-Seq data. 
The pipeline includes several steps, such as quality control, trimming, indexing, mapping, alignment, and transcript quantification. 
The tools used in this pipeline are FastQC, MultiQC, Trimmomatic, Indexing and a mapping/alignment with Bowtie2 and transcript quantifictaion with featurecount.
